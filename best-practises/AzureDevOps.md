## **Creating the perfect Azure DevOps culture for best practice.**

- Azure DevOps supports creating a collaborative working environment that combines both IT operations and development to generate services, products, and tools. 

- This is important for any development team, as it’s the first step to creating a perfect working environment. If the development environment isn’t well organized, then it is very hard for any team to be productive. 

- By using the Azure DevOps tool for best practice, you will get some exciting advantages like traceability, diagnosing resources, providing permissions, and more. 

- For this purpose, Azure DevOps includes an exciting tool named Azure Pipeline. This tool is a combination of both Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It also supports you by building, testing, and releasing your code together. 

- Through the Azure DevOps tool, it’s very easy to create a development environment through the Azure DevOps portal. 

- To do this, you need to navigate to the Pipelines page, then choose environments, and lastly click on Create Environment. After that, provide the necessary information about the environment and then click on “create”.

- When you are creating an environment with Azure DevOps, you can easily keep an eye on the current working environment, like the commits or resources recently deployed to the environment. 

- You can check the history of deployment. Through Azure DevOps, you can connect to the services that are defined in the environment automatically.


## **Analysis of DevOps workflow**

- The most exciting benefit of Azure DevOps is that it enables integration with other tools and platforms. It allows you to analyze and select the best tools for the task. Azure DevOps allows you to track your work. For this purpose, you need to create work items. This work item can be issues, tasks, or something else. 

- You can choose various system processes such as Basic, Agile, Scrum, or Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) depending on your project needs. You have to fill in a form when creating a work item. In this form, you have to describe the work that needs to be done, assign new work to team members, check the current working status, or collaborate with other team members. 

- There are some prerequisites. You have to create and connect a project before you can include a work item. Besides, you have to add members or competitors and must be granted basic access before creating a work item. 

- Using the Azure DevOps tool, you can provide stakeholders access to a project that is private, but you can grant access to general stakeholders for a public project. You can create a checklist where you can open or modify work items, view boards, and add child tasks. 
Below are the fields that you may need to fill up when opening a work item.

1. **State** – When creating new work items, you need to provide the current state of the work, like progress. You need to continuously update it to visualize the current status.

2. **Reason** – You need to provide the reason here. But you need to use it as the default first.

3. **Area** – You can leave it blank. You have to choose the path of the area associated with the project.

4. **Iteration** – Here you need to choose the iteration or sprint in which the work needs to be done. But you can leave it blank for a later assignment.

5. **Description** – This is the important field for opening a work item. Here you need to describe the full details of the task. Here you can include the goal of the task, special interactions, etc.

6. **Acceptance Criteria** – Here you need to provide the criteria that need to be met to close the work item. 

7. **Priority** – You can provide priority to the work items. There are different levels of priority available. When the priority is 1, it means the product can’t be shipped without successful completion of the task. When the priority is 2, that means the product needs successful completion and needs to be addressed immediately. When the priority level is 3, it means it’s an optional work item based on resources. Lastly, when the priority is 4, that means there is no requirement for the resolution of the work.

8. **Value Area** – You need to provide a rating for the work items related to the business. It is set to business by default , but you can set it to architectural if it’s related to technical services.

9. **Efforts, size, and Story points** – Provide the estimate of the work that is required to complete the issue or task.



## **Using automation**


- Azure DevOps supports automation, which is the biggest weapon for any developer team. It can create your work items automatically. You can run automated tests from your test plans by using Azure DevOps. To create automated test cases, the test cases must be in your test plans and need to be run directly from Azure Test Plans. We will share some benefits of automating tests below.

- First of all, it provides a user-friendly process for testing that may not be well versed in running tests in build or release workflows.

- Secondly, there is flexibility to run tests that are selected based on demand and requirements. You will have the ability to run tests again and again that failed due to some test infrastructure issues. Please note that your project must be connected, otherwise create a new one. Your team members must be added to your project, otherwise, they can’t contribute to the project events. But you can go for a manual tasting too.


## **Working with extension**


When you are done with the other practices, it’s time to work with some additional features of Azure DevOps. Azure DevOps also can provide you with additional tools for any development process by extensions. You can explore the extensions and find your required tool. Azure DevOps has a large collection of extensions for numerous purposes. There are some exciting extensions that can add value to your DevOps environment immediately. You can easily find them on Microsoft’s official marketplace for visual studios. These extensions are also known as ADO (Azure DevOps). Below shared some highly recommended extensions that you can use,

**Retrospectives** – It’s an extension that enriches the Azure Boards to a place where a can have to reflect, inspect, opportunity, and consider their last sprint. This extension is the key pillar of the scrum.

**Estimate** – It’s another extension that helps a team to come to an agreement transparently. It helps to create plans for their upcoming sprint. The most interesting thing about this extension is all the members of a team can vote simultaneously on the same item.

**Code Search** – This extension can go through the whole repositories of an organization. It also can create indexes by using the code search.
