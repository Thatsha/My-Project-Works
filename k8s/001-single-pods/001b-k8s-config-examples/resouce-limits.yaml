# This is a Kubernetes deployment manifest written in YAML, defining a deployment named "nginx-deployment" 
# that runs 5 replicas of an nginx container. The deployment uses a RollingUpdate strategy and listens on port 80. 
# The selector specifies that the deployment should manage pods with the label "app: web", 
# and the template defines the metadata and spec of the pods to create.

# In addition to the previous information, the configuration has specified resource limits and requests for the container. 
# The container is requesting 100m of CPU and 200Mi of memory, and setting a limit of 200Mi of memory.
